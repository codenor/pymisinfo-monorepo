This is a massive monorepo containing a bunch of things that might resemble an artificial intelligence. 

## Python dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- chromadb
- rich.progress?? (i dunno what pip pkg that is)

Because I have no idea how to use Python, I have added `assets/venv` into the `gitignore` file, so you may create & install dependencies there. 

Why am I using Python for this? I thought I needed it, and it turned out that I didn't really need to in the first place.
